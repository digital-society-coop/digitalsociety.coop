            originally approached us to build a heatpump installer directory in
            time for an event. User research revealed that users actually needed
            a holistic energy-saving calculator, and a more varied installer
            registry. Our agile, outcome-focused approach allowed us to pivot
            smoothly and deliver what became Orang Energy, a tool that better
            served users' needs.

            Working in an agile way, Chris and Endre consistently met the aims
            of development sprints. Where the technical challenges arose or when
            late requirement changes were introduced, they communicated in a
            timely and proactive manner to solve any issues. Not only did they
            perform as an excellent software development team, they also showed
            great interest in the product design, and provided their own
            intelligent insights to help with the product design. I highly
            recommend Digital Society!
