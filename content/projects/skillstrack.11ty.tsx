            serves two key purposes. First, it provides youth work practitioners
            with a user-friendly tool to record and track the impact of their
            sessions on young people. Second, it enables organizations to
            demonstrate their collective impact to funders through aggregated,
            anonymized data dashboards.

            We couldn’t be happier with the experience we’ve had of working with
            Chris and Endre. Not only is the tool they designed exactly what we
            wanted (and more), their support to help us (and our co-design
            partners) realise it on behalf of the youth work sector was “above
            and beyond”. They were really interested in what we were trying to
            achieve and that together with their expertise, professionalism,
            friendliness and conscientiousness made them a pleasure to work
            with. The sprint model worked so well for us, it kept momentum going
            and it felt that every aspect of the work was purposeful and
            in-hand. We’re delighted that we will have an ongoing partnership
            with them as the tool is rolled out.
